# ASM330LHHG1

The ASM330LHHG1 is a 6-axis IMU featuring a 3-axis digital accelerometer and a 3-
axis digital gyroscope with an extended temperature range up to +125°C, designed to 
address automotive nonsafety applications.

ST's family of MEMS sensor modules leverages the robust and mature 
manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined 
accelerometers and gyroscopes to serve both the automotive and consumer 
markets. The ASM330LHHG1 is AEC-Q100 compliant and industrialized through a 
dedicated MEMS production flow to meet automotive reliability standards. All the 
parts are fully tested with respect to temperature to ensure the highest quality level.
The sensing elements are manufactured using ST's proprietary micromachining 
processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that allows 
the design of a dedicated circuit, which is trimmed to better match the characteristics 
of the sensing element.

The ASM330LHHG1 has a full-scale acceleration range of ±2/±4/±8/±16 g and a wide 
angular rate range of ±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000/±4000 dps that enables its 
usage in a broad range of automotive applications.
The device supports dual operating modes: high-performance mode and low-power mode.
All the design aspects of the ASM330LHHG1 have been optimized to reach superior output
stability, extremely low noise, and full data synchronization to the benefit of
sensor-assisted applications like dead reckoning and sensor fusion.

The ASM330LHHG1 is available in an overmolded 14-lead plastic, land grid array (LGA) package.
