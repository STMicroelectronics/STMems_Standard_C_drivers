In the 'driver' folder there are the driver files of Mems Sensor (.h and .c)
to be included in your project. 

Driver documentation can be generate using Doxigen tool.

The driver is platform independent, you need only to complete the two functions
for write and read from Mems Hardware Bus.

The files (.c) in 'example' folder, are examples showing how to integrate
the Standard C driver in a project. They are written for STM32
Microcontroller using CubeMX API, but you can use it as a guideline for
every hardware.
