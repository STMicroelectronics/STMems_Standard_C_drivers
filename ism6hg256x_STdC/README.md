# ISM6HG256X

The ISM6HG256X is a high-end, low-noise, low-power 6-axis IMU, featuring a 3-axis digital low-g accelerometer at 16 g, a 3-axis digital high-g accelerometer at 256 g, and a 3-axis digital gyroscope, which offers the best IMU sensor with a quad-channel architecture for processing acceleration and angular rate data on four separate channels (user interface, OIS, EIS, and high-g accelerometer data) with dedicated configuration, processing, and filtering along with a dedicated high-g sensor for high-g shock.

The ISM6HG256X enables edge computing, leveraging embedded advanced dedicated features such as a finite state machine (FSM) for configurable motion tracking and a machine learning core (MLC) for context awareness with exportable AI features for IoT applications.
The device supports the adaptive self-configuration (ASC) feature, which allows automatically reconfiguring the device in real time based on the detection of a specific motion pattern or based on the output of a specific decision tree configured in the MLC, without any intervention from the host processor.

The ISM6HG256X embeds a dedicated accelerometer sensor with an independent channel and filtering for high-g acceleration detection that perfectly matches shock requirements for asset tracking, robotics & factory automation, condition monitoring, and worker PPE (personal protective equipment).
