# LSM6DSV80X

The LSM6DSV80X is a breakthrough in the world of wearable technology. Its ability to handle both high and low acceleration values, combined with its energy efficiency and advanced processing capabilities, makes it a sensor for anyone looking to
acquire data for in-depth analysis and achieve better performance in high-intensity impact and tracking activities in sports such as volleyball, soccer, tennis, boxing, or explosive jumps, and so forth. This IMU is a comprehensive solution for wearables, high-intensity impact and activity tracking, offering a blend of accuracy, integration, and efficiency.

The LSM6DSV80X is the world's first IMU to combine high-g (80 g) and low-g capabilities in a single package, integrating advanced features (edge processing and sensor fusion) and delivering consistent performance and
valuable data for tracking and high-intensity impact detection in sports wearables.

The device enables edge AI, leveraging on a finite state machine (FSM) for configurable motion tracking and a machine learning core (MLC) for context awareness with exportable AI features for wearable applications.

The LSM6DSV80X supports the adaptive self-configuration (ASC) feature, which allows automatically reconfiguring the device in real time based on the detection of a specific motion pattern or based on the output of
a specific decision tree configured in the MLC, without any intervention from the host processor.
