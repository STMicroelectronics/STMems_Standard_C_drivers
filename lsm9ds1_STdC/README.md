# LSM9DS1

The LSM9DS1 is a system-in-package featuring a
3D digital linear acceleration sensor, a 3D digital
angular rate sensor, and a 3D digital magnetic
sensor.

The LSM9DS1 has a linear acceleration full scale
of ±2g/±4g/±8/±16 g, a magnetic field full scale of
±4/±8/±12/±16 gauss and an angular rate of
±245/±500/±2000 dps.

The LSM9DS1 includes an I2C serial bus
interface supporting standard and fast mode
(100 kHz and 400 kHz) and an SPI serial
standard interface.

Magnetic, accelerometer and gyroscope sensing
can be enabled or set in power-down mode
separately for smart power management.

The LSM9DS1 is available in a plastic land grid
array package (LGA) and it is guaranteed to
operate over an extended temperature range
from -40 °C to +85 °C.
